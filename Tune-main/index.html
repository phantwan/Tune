			“How might we help the elderly enjoy old music that they
			can relate to?”</div>

		<div class="sub-title"><b>The <br>Context</b> </div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-6">

				<p>
					Nowadays, the elderly are increasingly forced to
					interface themselves with new technologies: these technologies
					are very distant from their way of thinking and interacting with the world;
					meanwhile, they are more used to interface themselves with physical objects and tangible
					concepts.

				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					If only they had a chance to understand and use them easily,
					these technologies could improve the elderly’s daily activities
					helping them in facing difficulties and relieving the sense of
					loneliness which often pervades their days making them feel distant
					and isolated from the world.

<div class="sub-title"><b>The <br> Problem</b> </div>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-6">

		<p>
			To relieve the sense of loneliness, the elderly often turn on the television or the radio, using sounds as a
			background that keeps them company during the day. Usually, the music does not match their taste, and
			they have trouble choosing freely what to listen to because of the technological gap.

		</p>


	</div>
</div>

<div ><h1>The Big Idea</h1> </div>
<div>

	<p>
		It is from here that we want to give a meaning to that “background sound”:
		<br>
		We want to provide a way to engage elderly
		through the music, which is seen as an opportunity
		to make the elderly recall their memories, and
		consequently express themself, collecting and
		sharing their own experience with it.

	</p>


</div>

<div class="sub-title"><b>Conclusions  <br>and Design <br>Reccomendations </b> </div>


<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-6">


		<p>
			Tune is born to give the elderly the opportunity to recover music of their time, collect
			their special songs related to their own expeirences and make them able to share
			and express themselves through it.

			To enable the elderly in doing this, we designed a system to make music tangible,
			taking the advantages of the NFC technology embedded within cards that can save
			the song played by a device specially designed for elderly too. This device, that
			plays mostly songs before the 2000s, has an old radio style appearance with
			analogic controllers studied to be easily recognizable and accpeted by elderly as a
			product related to music.
